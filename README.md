# Transit

## Adding a new provider
If you want a provider that isn't included please feel free to add one. Ideally
these providers won't be coupled to the system but more research needs to be
done for dynamically injecting reducers and sagas. In the meantime please add
reducers and sagas in the following files:

1. Reducers go in `providers/reducers/index.js`
2. Sagas go in `providers/sagas/index.js`

## Roadmap
